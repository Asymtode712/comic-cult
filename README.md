## ü§î What challenges I ran into

<table>
    <tr>
      <td>Comic Art generation</td>
      <td>I wanted to make something that is of fun and also gives me a lot of learning I used apis of openAi even utilized the langchain for some instances but wanted to take my level above, I wanted to play around with images that directed me of using any stable diffusion model (which I had no Idea how to use) I tried running model locally also used google collab however all these things made me more perplexed at the end I was in the need of some Stable diffusion API and key which dream-studio and Stability AI provided</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Workflow/pipeline of making</td>
      <td>Probably I worked for this part mostly such a pipeline was the backbone of this project, I was too confused and wanted to leave project for once however, I slowly worked of making a streamlined flow of generating dialogues (gemini helped) and then getting images(Stability API helped) based on that dialogue, adding dialogues onto images(Canvas helped), all these steps I wanted to be reliable and smooth which could provide happy user experience </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Using promises</td>
      <td>I have only heard and learned about promises and never utilized them in my any of the project until now, oh man they were life saver, they helped me in making and flow better and workable, I literally now want to use promises everywhere, I really got the understand of promises, async await, .then and catch</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>failure of express func and integration of nodemailer</td>
      <td>I am using express for my backend to serve front of various routes I never thought that res.sendfile, res.download would be so pathetic to use, they are made to sendfile from backend to frontend and guess what they were giving errors for the same, almost at this point also I am thinking to use them but they were so un-useful but then nodemailer came, I had this thought in back of my mind that if express functions does not work I will try sending pdf to user mail and using nodemailer this was so useful that I never imagined basically in few minutes I did this </td>
